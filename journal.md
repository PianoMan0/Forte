I am on a mission to create the ultimate voice assistant.

# May 29, 2025: Initial planning (1.5 hours)
Today is my first day creating my voice assistant, which I've decided to name Forte! 
I have been making voice assistants since I began coding (Rip Rico, who I spent dozens of hours hardcoding). Now it's time to level up, and turn it into an Alexa-like assistant that I can keep in my room! I'm going to use Python for this project. Here's a brain dump of my plan for materials:

I'm planning to spend roughly $150 on this project (6 points for Highway). I'll need materials for the core hardware and for the audio equipment. I might have some add-ons, but I haven't decided on that yet.

I want to get a **Raspberry Pi 4 Model B** to use as the computer. There's different amounts of storage I can choose, but I'm going to go with 4GB for now. It should cost about $60. It has wifi, bluetooth, ethernet, and multiple usb ports, which is great for my assistant, because I want it to have many functions.

I'll need a MicroSD card, but good thing I already have one from Hack Club's Cafe! It has 64GB. That saves me about $10.

As for the power supply, I want to use the Official Pi 4 PSU, which costs about $10.
